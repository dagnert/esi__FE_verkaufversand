## Demo

This repository is meant for a clean versioning and development of the frontend functionalities. It is developt in combination with the repository "ESI_PROD_2020_Lambda" which includes the backend parts (Lambda functions) corresponding to this frontend webapp.
Here you see an overview of the services and how they play together:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm (Alternative is yarn)
- Editor, for example https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Webbrowser, for example Firefox

In the project directory, you can run:

### How to install and start the App with NPM
When the folder is downloaded and unziped make sure to run `npm install` in the directory first, to download all dependencies and node modules needed for the framework. This has to be done every time you add or modify the package.json file.
Afterwards, run `npm start` to start the app locally under http://localhost:3000

Here are some useful informations regarding the react documentation:

#### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
